## Review from Last-time:
   1. Models
      * MW class
        - very important
         - the world is complex and we need to make it simpler to under it.
         - we can devise a solution
         - we can implement a solution
         - we can debug/maintain that solution
      * TR
        - they are essential to providing a service to our customers
        - needed to understand and describe a problem
        - needed to understand and to implement a solution
        - needed to understand and to reason about system failures

   1. Layers of Communication: Networking Model
      - four layers  for TCP/IP model
      - seven layers for OSI/ISO model
      - TCP/IP is a subset of the OSI/ISO model
      - Different protocols at each layer
      - Different analogies at each layer


   1. The names of layers
      1. Physical             | flash light tag                   |  interface | symbols
      2. Data / Data Link     | solo cup <-- string --> solo cup  |  MAC       | frames
      3. Network / Internet   | passing notes in class            |  IP        | packets
      4. Tranport             | certified mail                    |  socket    | segments
         - TCP (Traffic Congestion Protocol)

      5. (Session)
      6. (Presentation)
      7. Application                                              | URL
